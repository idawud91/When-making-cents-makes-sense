# When-making-sense-makes-cents
Years ago I spoke with someone from a large consulting and researching firm, who told me about an analysis they conducted looking at the relationship between pay understanding and perceptions of pay fairness. In other words, how do employees feel about their pay when they understand how it was determined?
The results show that when employees understand what factors go into their pay they're more satisfied with it. Even when compared to their peers with higher pay, who did not understand the determinates of their compensation. 

I was fascinated by this results, though I don't believe this company ever published their findings. So, I decided to try to recreate this on my own. 

I'm still collecting the responses but I will add my analysis and findings once I do. In the meantime, please consider participating [in my survey](https://forms.fillout.com/t/ajUgnVBAu4us).
